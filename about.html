            <p class="about">My name is John Rodriguez and I am a retired US Navy senior chief petty officer and an experienced electronics technician. I have a passion for learning new skills and staying updated with the latest technologies and trends in the field of electronics. I have worked on several innovative and challenging projects, such as installing and implementing the Navyâ€™s newest Key Operating Account Manager (KOAM) system, auditing and evaluating the system operations of an at-sea submarine, and diagnosing and conducting emergent repairs to critical communications systems. I am currently working as an Engineering Technician IV at Sparton, where I perform and write detailed test procedures to validate equipment design and operation at the system level. I also have excellent recruiting skills, which I acquired during my three-year assignment as a Navy Recruiter Station Supervisor in Winter Haven, FL. <br><br>

                Apart from my professional career, I love my family first and foremost. I have a wonderful wife and four amazing kids who support me in everything I do. I enjoy spending quality time with them and making them happy. I also love riding motorcycles, which is one of my hobbies. I find it thrilling and relaxing to ride on the open road and explore new places. I have a Harley-Davidson Sportster that I take good care of and customize to my liking. Riding motorcycles is also a way for me to connect with other people who share the same interest and passion. I am always eager to learn more about motorcycles and improve my riding skills.
